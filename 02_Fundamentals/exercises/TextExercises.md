### #2
Consider the following program:

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
	printf("Parkinson's Law:\nWork expands so as to");
	printf("fill the time\n");
	printf("available for its completion.\n");
	return 0;
}
```

a) Identify the directives and statements in this program
- Directives are the `#include`
- Statements are everything in the function.  All the `printf` statements and the `return` statement
b) What output does the program produce?

```
Parkinson's Law:
Work expands so as tofill the time
available for its completion.
```
