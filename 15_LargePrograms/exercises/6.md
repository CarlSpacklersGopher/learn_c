Refers to exercise 5

a) Which files need to be compiled when the program is built for the first time?
	- All source files, so main.c, f1.c, and f2.c
b) If `f1.c` is changed after the program has been built, which files need to be recompiled?
	- Only f1.c
	- Recompiling f1.c creates a new f1.o, so any program relying on f1.o (demo) will need to be re-made (re-linked?), but not recompiled.
c) If `f1.h` is changed after the program has been built, which files need to be recompiled?
	- ~~None?  Only header files changing does not mean that the source necessarily needs to change?~~  Incorrect.  
	- Any c file that includes f1.h needs to be recompiled, so that's main.c, f1.c, and f2.c
d) If `f2.h` is changed after the program has been built, which files need to be recompiled?
	- f1.c and f2.c
