A pointer is basically the memory address of an object.

Pointers can only point to a type of object as called out in the declaration (i.e. only integers if the pointer is called out as an int variable)

Instantiation:
```
int *p;    /* Points only to integers     */
double *q; /* Points only to doubles      */
char *r;   /* Points only to characters   */

```

A pointer can point to any type of object (even another pointer)
